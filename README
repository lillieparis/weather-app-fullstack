This web application is a microservice-based full-stack weather application built using Spring Boot for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend. 
In its development, I put particular in learning backend frameworks and tools like: Eureka, Jenkins, API Gateway, etc.

---Functionality---


---Backend Mechanisms---
For Service Registry and Service Discovery of the microservices, I added a Eureka Server. This addition, for example, allows 
communication between the user-service and weather-service microservices. This is relevant since each user has saved locations for which 
the weather must be fetched. The weather data is fetched from a public weather API (https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json) and is 
updated each time a user's web page is refreshed. 

---Frontend to Backend Connection---
After developing the backend, I added a frontend which takes the backend endpoints and displays the corresponding data using Vue.js.

In order to run the project on your own device. Clone the repository in an IDE of your choice. You must have npm and node installed. Then,
follow these steps:


To start the backend:
Within each microservice: weather-service, user-service, 
gateway-api, and the eureka-server using the following command:
./mvnw spring-boot:run

Then can view all the microservices running on the Eureka server at: 

http://localhost:8761

Then, to start the frontend, just ru in the frontend/weather-app-frontend directory:

npm run dev 

Backend endpoints: localhost:9191/
